**Published**: 2024 (arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.16859)

## Overview

This repository provides the code used to evaluate various transfer learning models for breast cancer classification, as described in our paper. The study compares multiple deep learning architectures and highlights performance metrics across different models applied to histopathology images.

### Models Evaluated:
- ResNet-50
- DenseNet-121
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
- ResNeXt-50
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
- GoogLeNet (Inception v3)
- EfficientNet
- MobileNet
- SqueezeNet

### Dataset:
- The dataset used in this study can be found on Kaggle: [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)
